 1. surface temperature (monthly data)  
a) Calculate the surface temperature anomaly.
The anomaly is achieved by subtracting the annual cycle from the t2m data.Annual cycle: average of the same month of each year.  
b) Extract the December&January&February(DJF)  
c) Calculate the average values of South-east of CHINA (20º-40ºN, 100-125ºE)

 2. nino3.4 index  
 extract the DJF month from the original data
